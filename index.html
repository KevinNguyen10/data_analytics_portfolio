							<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
							<p>Project 1: <a href="https://github.com/KevinNguyen10/Automated_Stock_Research" target="_blank">Automated Stock News Research</a> <br>
								Created a python script where it would webscrape, summarize, and give a sentiment analysis of articles off of yahoo news. 
								The script grabs the top 5 articles from yahoo news if you search a stock ticker through google. It then grabs the URLS and will clean 
								the unwanted URLS and store the urls in a dictionary. Once the links are stored. It will get passed through a function that will
								grab the article and summarizes it into a short sentence. After it would give a sentiment analysis of the based on the summarize text 
								telling me if the particalar news article was positive or negative. I made this script because I when I was trading in the stock market
								I rarely looked at the news. I wanted to know what was going on with the stock I was trading to see if I should go long (buy) or short (sell).
								This script would help me do that by giving me a <a href="https://github.com/KevinNguyen10/Automated_Stock_Research/blob/main/assetsummaries.csv" target="_blank">quick overview</a> 
								of the news for the stock I was planning to trade. 
							</p>
							<p>Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/KevinNguyen10/etsy_product_reviews" target="_blank">Etsy Product Review Analysis</a> <br>
								Created a python script that would use the etsy API and get top 900 reviews on a digital planner product. It would then be used to perform text analysis
								to see what the top words were used in the reviews. I made this script because I was interested in text analytics and I also had a friend that wanted to 
								make a digital planner to potentially put on ETSY. So I made this script that would help see what people were looking for in a digital planner and apply their
								responses to the digital planner my friend was going to make.
